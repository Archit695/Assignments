    "1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "Ans: def statement is used to create a normal function. where as lamba expressions are used to create Anonymous functions. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.\n",
    "           Lambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we'd put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement."

    "\n",
    "1. Can be used to create Nameless/Anonymous functions inside some complex functions if we are planning to use it only once.\n",
    "2. Moderate to small functions can be created in a single line\n",
    "3. Fuctions created using lambda expressions can be assigned to a variable and can be used by simply calling the variable"

    "3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "Ans: The differences between map, filter and reduce are:\n",
    "\n",
    "map(): The map() function is a type of higher-order. This function takes another function as a parameter\n",
    "along with a sequence of iterables and returns an output after applying the function to each iterable present in the sequence.\n",
    "filter(): The filter() function is used to create an output list consisting of values for which the function returns true.\n",
    "reduce(): The reduce() function, as the name describes, applies a given function to the iterables and returns a single value"

    "Ans: Function annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary python expressions at compile time.\n",
    "Annotations of simple parameters def func(x: expression, y: expression = 20):\n",
    "Whereas the annotations for excess parameters are as âˆ’ def func (**args: expression, **kwargs: expression):"

    "Ans: A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. The process may repeat several times, outputting the result and the end of each iteration."
