/
+
6
S1)~ 
Values :-   &#39;hello&#39;
            -87.8

                +2. What is the difference between string and variable?
S2)~
String is a type of data or information stored in a variable.String is written in quotes like "Bingo".3. Describe three different data types.
S3)~
~Int - They are integers. Integers can be positive, negative and zero.
~Float - They are floating point number. eg- 97.0 , 58.65
~complex - They can have two parts, one positive and one negative.4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
S4)~
An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.Any value is an expression.
An expression is a type of instruction that combines various values and needed to be evaluate to get a result.
5). This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
S5)~
An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.
The statement is a command which is to be interpreted by python, eg, input, print. 

6). After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
S6)~

# In[3]:


bacon = 23
bacon+1
print(bacon)

7). What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam'*3
S7)~They will be same

# In[6]:


'spam'+'spamspam'


# In[7]:


'spam'*3

8). Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
S8)~
100 is an integer and integer cannot be used as a variable.9). What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
S9)~
For integer - int()
For floating - float()
For string - str()
10). Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten'  + 99 + 'burritos'
S10)~
# In[9]:


'I have eaten'  + 99 + 'burritos'
# 99 is an integer and cannot concatenate with string.
