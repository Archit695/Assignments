    "1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "Ans: __iter__ and __next__ are the operator overloading methods in python that support iteration and are collectively called iterator protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "__iter__ returns the iterator object and is called at the start of loop in our respective class.\n",
    "__next__ is called at each loop increment, it returns the incremented value. Also Stopiteration is raised when there is no value to return."

    "The main purpose of __str__ is for readability. it prints the informal string representation of an object, one that is useful for printing the object. it may not be possible to convert result string to original object.__repr__ is used to print official string representation of an object, so it includes all information and development."
